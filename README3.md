# **INSTRUCTIONS**

The goal of this exercise is to create the foundation of our Todo model and implement functionality to delete and update Todos from the database using Knex.

## Now Let's Code

### At this point you should have the Knex.js [documentation](https://knexjs.org/#Builder) and or [cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/knex) open for reference

* [ ] In `/models/todo.js` implement a `destroy` function that deletes a todo from the `'todo'` table.
* [ ] In your `/routes/api-routes.js` modify the DELETE route for deleting a todo to make it use your Todo model.
* [ ] Test your refactored functionality by trying to delete a Todo from the browser.

If your first method is working, CONGRATS, now move on to the next function!

* [ ] In `/models/todo.js` implement an `update` function that updates a todo into the `'todo'` table.
* [ ] In your `/routes/api-routes.js` modify the PUT route for updating a todo to make it use your Todo model.
* [ ] Test your refactored functionality by trying to update a Todo from the browser.

### W00T Let's Move On
